These are my personal emacs configuration files. Feel free to use any of it as you see fit.

Many of the configuration snippets have been stolen from various sources including:  
[Emacs wiki](http://www.emacswiki.org)  
[Emacs-fu](http://emacs-fu.blogspot.co.uk)  
[What the emacs.d?](http://whattheemacsd.com)  
and many other sources that I cannot remember.
